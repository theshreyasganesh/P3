Review Instructions
Project Directory: Ensure you have the project directory containing the necessary files.

Problem 1: JavaScript Date Picker:

Open DatePicker.js to review the implementation of the DatePicker class.
Check for the following:
The DatePicker class constructor correctly accepts an ID attribute and a callback function.
The render method generates a one-month calendar correctly.
The calendar displays days of the selected month in a grid with proper headers.
Calendar navigation controls ("<" and ">") are functional.
Clicking on valid days invokes the callback function correctly.
Verify that datepicker.css is properly utilized for styling the date picker.



Problem 2: Simple Table Template Processing:

Open TableTemplate.js to review the implementation of the TableTemplate class.
Check for the following:
The fillIn method correctly replaces placeholders with dictionary values.
Header row placeholders are replaced.
Data is populated in the specified column when a column name is provided.
The class handles missing or undefined dictionary properties gracefully.
Verify that template-processor.js from Project #2 is used appropriately for template processing.
Ensure that the visibility property of the table's style is handled correctly.

Testing:

Open datepicker.html and test-table.html to ensure they run without errors.
Test the functionality of both the date picker and table template processing in these HTML files.

Check if contributors' names (if applicable) are correctly listed.
Ensure that any relevant licensing information is provided.
